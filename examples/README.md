This directory contains scripts for using and visualizing the results 
of the machine learning workflow stored in this repository. Scripts
and notebooks are named after the figures that are in the manuscript.

# Provenance
The following are files in this directory that were not generated by
the ML workflow but are still used by the visualization. An explanation
of the source of each file is below.
+ `S19S_colocated_for_validation.csv` was copied from [global-river-databases](https://github.com/parallelworks/global-river-databases/blob/main/scripts/step_04_output.csv) and stored here for convenience. This file contains the data in RiverAtlas that correspond to this site to check that the colocation routines generate consistent results.
+ `RiverAtlas_GLORICH_colocated_for_prediction.csv` as copied from [global-river-databases](https://github.com/parallelworks/global-river-databases/blob/main/scripts/step_10_output.csv) and is stored here for convenience. This file contains all the colocated RiverAtlas and GLORICH data for making predictions.
